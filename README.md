# Transform-Python-script-into-Userfriendly-AI-powered-Solutions
We’ve created a platform where you can seamlessly transform your Python scripts into user-friendly AI-powered solutions and do so FOR FREE. We call these solutions AI Widgets - compact applications that automate a specific task by collecting the required inputs from its users and generating the desired outputs.

Simply upload your Python project, layer it with input fields and Voilà, it’s ready – to be used by you or anyone else.

Once your widget is created you can either post it on our marketplace or generate a private link to be shared with your clients, who can use it without needing any technical skills. This means instant scaling and monetization for your inventions without barriers like creating the front- and back-ends, hosting the app, navigating legal and financial challenges, etc.

our mission is to bring talented developers like you together with people who can benefit from your solutions, while ever empowering and facilitating each side.

After a long journey, we’re excited to announce that our Beta is Live! Now, we need your help to bring it to life. We’re looking for Python either create widgets directly or provide us with Python Scripts that we will turn it into widgets ourselves.
==============
Python script template for building an AI Widget on Abyss that transforms Python scripts into user-friendly AI-powered solutions. This example creates a text summarization widget using a Python script leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
Python Script for AI Widget

import openai

# Set up your OpenAI API key (replace 'your-api-key' with your actual key)
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

def summarize_text(input_text: str, summary_length: int) -> str:
    """
    Summarize the input text using OpenAI's GPT-4 API.

    Args:
        input_text (str): The text to summarize.
        summary_length (int): Desired length of the summary in sentences.

    Returns:
        str: The summarized text.
    """
    try:
        # Call the GPT model to summarize the text
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant that summarizes text."},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Please summarize the following text in {summary_length} sentences:\n\n{input_text}"}
            ],
            temperature=0.7
        )
        summary = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
        return summary.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"

# Example usage for testing
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_text = (
        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the world as we know it. "
        "From healthcare to finance, AI is being used to solve complex problems "
        "and improve efficiency. However, with great power comes great responsibility, "
        "and it is critical to ensure that AI systems are used ethically and responsibly."
    )
    summary = summarize_text(sample_text, summary_length=2)
    print("Original Text:\n", sample_text)
    print("\nSummarized Text:\n", summary)

Steps to Convert to an Abyss AI Widget

    Prepare the Script:
        Save the above script as text_summarizer.py or any relevant name.

    Upload the Script to Abyss:
        Go to Abyss Hub.
        Upload your script as an AI Widget.
        Define input fields such as:
            input_text (TextArea): Text to summarize.
            summary_length (Integer): Number of sentences for the summary.

    Configure Outputs:
        Set the widget's output to display the summarized text.

    Test and Deploy:
        Use the platform's testing tools to validate the functionality.
        Publish the widget in the marketplace or generate a private link to share with clients.

Key Features of Abyss for Developers

    No Backend Required: Focus solely on your script logic while Abyss handles deployment and user interaction.
    Revenue Opportunities: Monetize your widgets directly in the marketplace.
    Scalability: Your widgets are instantly scalable with Abyss' infrastructure.
